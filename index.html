<h4>Abstract</h4>
This thesis investigates the fragility, materiality, and temporality of the World Wide Web within the context of human–technological evolution. It reflects on the internet as being an extension of the dichotomy of being an immortal utopia and an ephemeral, transient dystopia of the Anthropocene.

Through a combination of personal narrative, media theory, and digital archaeology, the thesis examines a lifelong relationship with the web—from early experiences with computers and gaming to professional practice in design and web development. The research traces the shift from the open, communal spirit of the early “handmade web” to a corporatized, cloud-based, and increasingly opaque digital infrastructure. Central to this exploration is the phenomenon of “digital decay”: the disappearance of independent creative websites, type foundries, and online archives, revealing the paradox of a supposedly permanent medium built on transient and privately owned systems.

Examining the web as both a living archive and a decaying organism, ever-expanding, yet ephemeral, record of human intention, memory, and loss. Through speculative inquiry and digital collection practices, it seeks to uncover the archaeology of our online existence and confront the existential tension between immaterial data and its deeply material foundations.

By engaging with concepts such as the Dead Internet Theory, the material infrastructure of the cloud, and case studies like the death of Adobe Flash or the shutdown of Parler, the thesis interrogates what it means for the internet to “die” or be “reborn.” 

Ultimately the questions arise: what remains of our culture when the servers go dark? What does it mean to preserve or resurrect the digital in an era of algorithmic authorship and artificial intelligence?

<span class="quote-big">The real problem of humanity is the following: we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology. – Edward O. Wilson 1929, American sociobiologist<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn01" id="ref01">[01]</a></sup>

<h4 id="a01">Foreword</h4>
I witnessed the new millenia. When I was 6 years old, I was gifted a gameboy and had my first interactions with technology with a processing unit, a computer in other terms. Interaction with this device enarmored me from the beginning and clutched me in it's grasp ever so tightly. Was it escapism, the moment to have a different reality at your fingertips, a different world. A realm of my own. It seems those feeling have not diminished and would just transform or translate to new devices and mediums. I played on the old computer of my father for hours a game, where one would smash the desktop as a fictional image or burn it, or hammer on it. A surreal thing, the digital. Pixel, which in turn are just colored dots on a grid flare up and create an image. Similar to the "The horse in motion"<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn02" id="ref02">[02]</a></sup>, stills of a horse rider riding as birth point for film and animation, where enough images in successive speed let us think a real motion is happening in front of our eyes, the same happens with our eyesight, as we see thousands of tiny spots that build one image.

Things changed the moment I had my very first own computer. Where gaming was my main entry point before, there was now another one. The world wide web. Reading stuff on the internet, videos, images, looking up stuff, listening to music through the internet, where it was before bound to be shared by bluetooth or burning discs here and there. And it has not changed to this day. I am bound to this medium day and night, it's a fixed constant in my life. Be it the working life, entertainment, my way of wayfinding, gateway to information. The endless working network that is the internet is always part of my life.

This seems not the outlier or unique situation. The internet commands, assists and is part of all populated/city-bound society (using services like Starlink, opens up even remote regions, never being able to connect before). Modern society, capitalism and the current anthropocene rest on the pillars of an almost instant, effortless, barrierfree information system that links millions of machines to each other to make the pixels on each of our devices flare.

Workwise, the world wide web has always interested me. After my first graphic design diploma I built my very own websites, crudely with html and css in the editor and browser, then in the early arrival era of site-builders which made it more visual, easier to grasp for a designers mind. But both ways, became slowly maybe not completely part of my practice. I still think I am first and foremost a designer at heart, but slowly interacting with the building blocks of the web, changed my way to look at design. I started to think in modularity, repetition, automation, leaving the flat plane of design and going into the creation of subset and rules, systems to make your visual communication stand out and communicate precise and holistic. All of this, and of course my environment and the chaotic-neutrality of life itself, led my down a path, where I worked as User Interface Designer, User Experience Designer, Low-Code Developer, study in a class in germany focused on bridging the gap or space between design and the digital, to creating websites flat with design software to programming them by hand. Being a tiny part of the handmade web for some parts, shaping capitalist outer exteriours for brand on others. Engulfed in the internet, there was only question that persists and wavered over my head like the sword over the head of Damocles<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn03" id="ref03">[03]</a></sup>.

We know how the internet started, but do we know how it will end? Memento Mori<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn04" id="ref04">[04]</a></sup>Perhaps to be reanimated by the Internet Archive in the near-future—reshared on a federated social network, accessible only by an alpha-numeric sequence of letters and numbers described by users as a “hash”, re-syndicated through a decades old protocol (three times removed from its original intent), transmitted through conduits of optical fiber crossing continental distances, buried and submerged—everywhere and nowhere at the same time.<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn05" id="ref05">[05]</a></sup>

<h4 id="a02">The Web as Hyperobject and reborn Herald of the Anthropocene</h4>

Using the World Wide Web, one can collect and curate knowledge and insights using their respective url/links to find them at a later point. An endless library to be filled by own interests and tracking your individual journey through the web. A personal "Archive of the Planet"<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn06" id="ref06">[06]</a></sup>in the digital realm.
<span class="quote">"All creative works that can be put into digital form can be linked in a way that depends on nothing but the intellectual content of the material itself - no reliance on remote servers or any organization. It is simply a mathematical function on the actual intellectual content, and people would need nothing more than the function."</span><sup><a class="ref" href="fn07" id="ref07">[07]</a></sup>

 Using an online platform for storing text, images and aforementioned links, I am collecting various bits of research, inspiration, visualities and thoughts from passing through the various sites that make up my internet history.
 
 <span class="quote">The typical setup of the museum-as-factory looks like this. Before: an industrial workplace. Now: people spending their leisure time in front of TV monitors. Before: people working in these factories. Now: people working at home in front of computer monitors.</span><sup><a href="#fn08" class="ref" id="ref08">[08]</a></sup>
 
 It started as a way to collect my knowledge of websites of independent, non profit, free, open source type foundries, artists, designers websites etc. Each typedesigner used the web as a tool, one could classify of a utopian world (partly it still does fulfil parts of it, but only partially) to offer thoughts/material to be given without cost to educate, spread and create something anew together.So I collected thousands of links, hundreds of type foundries and websites of designers for their visuality, their typefaces to use in my practice or as inspiration for their intricate web designs. Like my own little library, museum or storage space, where I worked to collect what matters for my practice and paradigms.

<h4 id="#a03"">Unearthening the graveyards of the world wide web</h4>

I encountered my first dead link, looking for free/open source, independent created typefaces in my channel "OPEN FREE FOUNDRIES FOR FUTURE". It must have been a search for a typeface for an experimental or studies related project, as there was no budget for typefaces and I started to look for free alternatives. When I visited one of the links, the website was not hosted there anymore. And this started to happen more often, time passed, and always when I came back to look for typefaces in my "Channel" to find out, even more links are broken, the websites were gone. What I didn’t expect, was the amount and speed at which a lot of those websites that offered free typefaces vanished. They were taken off the internet, without any way to find them again, as they were too independent/too small/too niche to be catalogued somehow with services like The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, apart from as an example people (collectors, digital hoarders) like me.

So when I try to revisit those sites, they are gone. The typefaces are gone. The people who put them up to be downloaded, had a change of plans, no money, had to work on other projects, did not identify with their work anymore, didn’t want to have them downloaded to free, we can think of many reasons but as they are gone as of now, gone without traces, we might never know. Maybe the people died and the payment for the servers run out. We don’t know without actively researching and its still not guaranteed we will find out. But I have the underlying thought, it's reasons are probably rooted in our capitalist and energy put-in, energy get-out society, work and monetary, fiscal reasons.

<span class="quote">In this economy, even spectators are transformed into workers. As Jonathan Beller argues, cinema and its derivatives (television, Internet,  and so on) are factories, in which spectators work.</span><sup><a href="#fn09" class="ref" id="ref09">[09]</a></sup>

This made me think about our preconception of what the internet is, was or could be. I always thought as a medium it excels in exactly those qualities. Its never shut off, as with technologies like Starlink independent from most of earth's environmental factors.

<span class="quote">Over the last several years, much of our digital media has migrated to what came to be known as “the Cloud.” Stacks of CDs and DVDs and CD-ROMs have given way to cloud accounts and streaming services. The old material forms were already examples of digital media. But now that our data is more likely to be stored at distant data centres rather than discs we store at home, it becomes increasingly plausible to imagine the digital sphere as an immaterial realm.</span><sup><a href="#fn10" class="ref" id="ref10">[10]</a></sup>

It could appear as transcendence of our content. But this might be an illustion, as its still bound to physical objects that store said data, even if we give our data in the "clouds" ephereal qualitites with a touch of techno-mysticism applied.
        
<span class="quote">The "cloud" metaphor only reinforces the idea of immateriality. But, once more, the truth is more complicated. The cloud is a metaphor for a thoroughly material infrastructure that makes cloud computing possible. Our data exists in massive data centres distributed throughout the world and made up of servers, routers, switches, and miles of cables, as well as redundant power sources, cooling and ventilation systems, and security apparatus.</span><sup><a href="#fn11" class="ref" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup>

Being able to copy and reproduce it self more quickly then other media we invented before, one would think its bound for infinity. There can and will always be backups of everything. There a different measures, projects and institutions to this day to save parts of it, like the Internet Archive.
    
<span class="quote">"We need to preserve this archive, it is the single most important thing we have. Without it there is nothing. It is a collection of everything we've ever done ever, nothing can live up to the scale of it. It needs to stay" – Comment by user @TheMiniMaestroMan on the video titled "The Internet Archive is WAY more important than you think" by Joey Yee</span><sup><a class="ref" href="#fn12" id="ref12">[12]</a></sup>
    
And even with those endeavors, crucial parts of the fabric of the net is lost in ephemeral web space. I think it is fascinating, that a medium, with the aformentioned qualities, is the one where I don't find independent works of art anymore, completely lost and gone with the push of a button. It seems contrary to the events, when Tim Berners-Lee made the internet, created hypertext, made the download button (which in turn is the only actual/personal ability to store something locally from the web). How does the internet differentiate to what it was before or would become. What if it is turned off. What is lost and what will stay. What would be the remnants of our digital era. A speculative mapping of the archaeology of the digital in the future.

<span class="quote">"The worldwide network of machines we have constructed, the vast databases of information we have assembled, and the countless lines of code we have written, are active participants in the world, and are increasingly capable of acting without human intervention or even intention. How we account for and live with this, how we share the world with active, non-human assemblages is one of the greatest (and most exciting!) challenges we are presented with."</span><sup><a href="#fn13" class="ref" id="ref13">[13]</a></sup>

<h4 a="">Collecting thoughts digitally</h4>
When going deeper in those questions, I think I want to collect and list excerpts, anecdotes, thoughts, hypothesis, ideas, quotes that I crudely, sometimes obvious and sometimes subtly relate to those questions. Like the project started for me naively as a collector of things and reach out, go into depth and broader as a collector of things. After all the internet might be nothing more than a collection of text written on servers that are linked with each other. Its a latent space, hard to peek behind it’s veil of technological mysticism and aura <sup><a href="#fn14" class="ref" id="ref14">[14]</a></sup>, while still being a physical as well as metaphysical object at it's core.

<h3>The material as its core</h3>

<span class="quote">Far from being an immaterial medium of human communication, digital media is built on an expansive, sophisticated, and costly material infrastructure that is more often than not removed from our everyday experience and that we are happy to ignore.</span><sup><a href="#fn15" class="ref" id="ref15">[15]</a></sup>

The internet's actual size or dimensions are hard to grasp, expansive and we don’t know if its morebroad or tall.         
<span class="quote">This quickly brings us back to the question of what we are trying to measure. Is the internet for browsing self-published websites? E-commerce? Messaging? Video streaming? Game playing? Social networks? While the intuitive answer might be all of the above, standardizing around a particular definition to accurately represent that reality has plagued internet researchers for decades, as has the location of the selected vantage points—where is Point A and Point B?</span><sup><a href="#fn16" class="ref" id="ref16">[16]</a></sup>
            
So adapting this framework, searching, listing, collecting and curating, presenting probable and not so probable answers, one might get a little foothold in an enormously broad and deep topic that bears intrinsic and medial complexity, while still staying true to the original questions that arose.

<h1>Anecdotes</h1>

<h4 id="#a_03">404 – Typefoundry not found</h4>
As part of my design and development practice, using a platform called <a href="https://www.are.na" target="blank">are.na</a> similar to image collecting platforms like Pinterest, but with a different business, philosophy and even algorithmic model. In that case, no algorithm to present a user "fitting" content and images/visuality/narratives. As part of my research I then save images, layouts, references for the design process, and also links to websites as inspiration and curation.

A big part of the design process, regardless of printed or digital matter, is the application of typography and typesetting. The hunt or search for said typefaces, happens in my case a lot through the search and knowledge of the transaction platforms of the creators *e.g. typeface designers of said typefaces. Typefoundries. As part of my use of are.na for collecting and curating to help myself in my design process, I save/link typefaces I encounter to certain channels in the platform to interact anew/acquire them at a later point if needed. Examples for those particular channels are <a href="https://www.are.na/omdd/type-open-free-foundries-for-future" target="blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.are.na/omdd/type-foundries-for-future" target="blank">here</a>...    

<h3>Dead Internet Theory</h3>
Upon my research of the relation of an end or "death" of the web, I stumbled on roots and crosswebs of an conspiracy theory called the "Dead Internet Theory". It details and paints a picture of the web, where most content we encounter online is not created by "human" users, but bot (automatic scripts, pre-written agents) often under the nefarious notion of an involvment with fake news, manipulation, big data, data minging, scamming. Theory like this conclude and grow exponentially with the rise of bots, robots, thoughts and theories accelerated by the sudden and speeding up rise of MLM and AI technology. In an era of AI and artifical web, where can we draw the line between conspiracy and obvious reality. The veil of what is happening behind Large Language Models that are connected to the web to either scrape data for their datasets from which they learn, to content being created by those AI's. There is a need to re-enter discussions and confronting those questions and conspiracies at the forefront of a new digital and language model inhabited era.

<h3>Death on the Dropbox</h3>
The Internet has grown beyond for what it was thought out to be. From creating personal webpages and writing personal logs, journals that became published blogs, it grew to store all our data, identity, and a track/journey that we take from the world wide web. As the ability to collect data and the ability of computerchips to store said data grew, we started to collect more and more type of data. First on storage mediums, like discs, until our local machines could save it, until we made our machines and technology slimmer to make it fit our dynamic and non-stationary lifestyles. So we sent and stored our data in the "cloud". In way nothing else, but an interface where we would send our data from our local machine to another machine, connected through the internet to store it. After all, in the end all is physical. <span class="quote">Importantly, each era of technology has a unique “phys- ics”—a term we use to describe the hard-coded mechanics and incentives of every media platform, whether digital or analog. Users are as bound to these conditions when op- erating within a given platform as they are to gravity when walking on Earth. Platform physics are the ways in which a medium’s design determines a piece of content’s nature, the content’s “natural motion” through a network, its recip- ients’ responses, and the various nth order effects of this content being in circulation.<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn17" id="ref17">[17]</a></sup></span>

After researching regarding the death of actual/physical/human users, I stumbled upon interesting bits of information, what happens with our dropbox data after we perish.

One service provider, that stores data this way is Dropbox Inc. If we die in the physical world, all the data we have stored within, as part of a dropbox account wont be deleted. A remaining relative of us, would have to legally force dropbox to either delete or send out the data it has saved from a deceased user. Usage and the behavior Big Tech and Big Data companies celebrate with our data, seem to remind of a black box, removed from it's properties as a device. Kybernetic and systemtechnologie phenomenons like the black box model come to mind, where the input and output of an experiment can be measured, but not what is inside. This comparison is maybe a bit far fetched, but as long as the users's data is a commodity owned and protected by the company, and the strife for transparence, regarding what happens with the data is still ongoing, it might feel like a process, where the creator of said data, the user has no insight into the process itself.

<span class="quote">The constitution and structure of the box are altogether irrelevant to the approach under consideration, which is purely external or phenomenological. In other words, only the behavior of the system will be accounted for. – Mario Augusto Bunge<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn18" id="ref18">[18]</a></sup></span>

After the inevitable – our own physical death, our heritage lives on digitally, on servers owned and hosted by a big corporation. Leading to another reflection on this fake ephemerality of the net, where we not users that leave the space, but are bound to our digital footprint in the digital, like flies stuck in the amber of time.


<h3 id="">Does the world wide web have a shelf life, by being owned physically?</h3>
In the wake of the political climate of the elections and era of trump administration, as well as the rise of hate-speech and radical content on social platforms like twitter, facebook,..., a new platform came to rise from it's competitiors. The platform called parler, advertised itself as harbinger of free speech and after Trumps Ban from twitter.com, saw sudden rise in user numbers and popularity from associated political camps.<sup><span></span></sup>

<span class="quote">"...The site effectively "went dark" after Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) suspended its web hosting service and will remain so unless it can find a replacement.
...The platforms said Parler was not doing enough to prevent the spread of posts inciting violence, following unrest at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters last Wednesday after weeks of violent rhetoric on online sites."<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn19" id="ref19">[19]</a></sup></span>

Parler has since then had to move offline as there was no competitor to AWS suitable to host its enormous data structure.<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn20" id="ref20">[20]</a></sup> Since then they are trying to relaunch, in essence having been broken from this ban by AWS. Without commenting on the political layer of the debate, what us this example shows, is also the newly notion of an owned web. When a large portion of the web is owned by corporations, which abide by their own rules and have the right as owners to discontinue services, it seems our current realities are drifting far away from what a soft or collaborative web was enviosioned to be, in its birthor even from now on.

<h4>Resurrection of dead.dot.com Titans</h4>

When looking at the history of the web and it's trajectory through time and it's distinct eras, the financial and economic cluster is always intertwined, as with all technological breakthroughs. With great economic boom, comes a bubble ready to burst at its fragile and speculative seams. This happened with the dotcom crash<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn21" id="ref21">[21]</a></sup> in 2001. We are seeing similar patterns and events with the connection of speculative, econimic market and digital technology, like the rise and shortlifed craze around NFTs. A project that artistically deals with both of those events is an art project by Simon Deny and Guile Twardowski in 2021. 

Dotcom Séance looks at time and the internet by reviving “dead” Web 1 companies with Web 3 technology. The selected companies were re-enlivened by being “conjured” through a series of AI-generated logos. Fed on prompts describing each company, the generated logos serve, in essence, as instances of the internet re-imagining itself. Twardowski also created one unique, bespoke rework of each company’s logo based on these outputs.<sup><a class="ref" href="#fn22" id="ref22">[21]</a></sup>

This project investigates the intersection of artificial intelligence and NFTs as symptomatic of broader technological and economic paradigms. It situates these developments within the accelerating cycles of innovation, speculation, and obsolescence that characterize contemporary digital culture. The work seeks to freeze a moment of technological and cultural significance—the emergence of blockchain-based art—at the threshold of its own decline.

Referencing the historical precedent of the dot-com crash, the project interrogates the paradox inherent in employing speculative technologies as both medium and subject. Through this lens, it draws attention to the repetition of economic and ideological patterns: the rise of techno-utopian narratives, the inflation of market-driven hype, and the inevitable collapse that follows.

By tracing the relational ties between open financial markets, internet-based corporations, and blockchain art economies, the research reveals a shared structural dependency on belief systems of immaterial value and technological progress. The ensuing crises—whether of trust, liquidity, or meaning—expose the fragility of these digital instruments and their entanglement with human economic desire.

Ultimately, the project reflects on the temporality and materiality of technological phenomena, positioning NFT and AI art within a continuum of digital speculation and decay. In doing so, it questions the ontological status of digital artworks as both products of and participants in the recursive dynamics of creation, commodification, and collapse.

<h3>The Adobe Flash butterfly effect</h3>

How transient the digital really is, can be observed in the Killing of Flash by Adobe and the subsequent public railroad halt in a northern chinese town for over twenty hours.

The train company in Dalia, China used an application written in Adobe Flash to run their internal technical system of the railroad network on it. Adobe announced 2017, they would subsequently kill their support and availibity of Flash online in exactly 3 years time.<span class="quote"> It's not like Flash's demise was sudden; it's been known since 2017 that it was going away, and this railroad somehow managed to ignore that until they had absolutely no choice, and everything stopped.</span><sup><a class="ref" href="#fn23" id="ref23-01">[23-01]</a></sup>

<span class="quote">"...I can't for the life of me fathom why anyone would want to run a freaking railroad network on it, with physical, multi-ton moving railcars full of human beings on it... – Jason Torchinsky</span><sup><a class="ref" href="#fn23" id="ref23-02">[23-02]</sup>

As technologies are changing, developing and also being gatekept for economic reasons, these events are bound to happen. 

<h4>2TB of the internet</h4>

In 2009, when Yahoo! announced the shutdown of GeoCities, a volunteer group known as Archive Team initiated a large-scale preservation effort. They managed to download and compress roughly 2 terabytes of data, encompassing millions of personal homepages created by users between the mid-1990s and early 2000s. This collection—often referred to as the “GeoCities Torrent” or “2TB of the Internet”—became both a digital time capsule and a symbol of the web’s fragility.

The materiality and digital-archaeological significance of user-created web pages become particularly evident in this case of an archival effort that sought to preserve the remnants of GeoCities prior to its deletion. As one of the earliest large-scale repositories of personal web expression, GeoCities embodies a crucial phase in the evolution of the participatory web: an era when the internet functioned as a site of amateur creativity, self-publishing, and communal experimentation.

The 2TB archive represents not merely a collection of obsolete HTML documents but a digital stratigraphy of early networked culture—traces of identity formation, aesthetic experimentation, and socio-technical engagement encoded within the markup itself. From a media-archaeological perspective, these sites constitute artifacts that reveal both the technical affordances and the ideological frameworks of their time. The simplicity of their code, the conspicuousness of their visual design, and the idiosyncratic nature of their content collectively speak to a form of digital materiality often effaced by the seamless, corporate infrastructures of today’s web.

The phrase “2TB of the Internet” entered discourse as a metaphor for the scale and materiality of loss in the digital age. It emphasizes how the seemingly immaterial world of web pages, hyperlinks, and online communities is grounded in very real storage media, servers, and data infrastructures. In media-archaeological terms, it represents a moment of excavation—a mass retrieval of digital strata before their erasure.


<h4>Saving the web, one bit at a time</h4>

So is there a looming threat on the horizon of the tangled spaces of digital refuge we call the world wide web? As a steadily expanding medium, in a process of evolution and regression by gaining new breakthroughs digitally (new technologies, AI and LLMs) and shrinking physical barriers (satelite network connection, glas fibre connections, smartphone boom) all over the world. An extension of our human-technological evolution, we have to look at the web as part of not only our history but also our heritage and remnants we will leave our era of being part of this ecosystem. And despite efforts, it is not given, that we will be able to historically archive these steps or won't loose all of it by ignoring the physical aspects of the fragile technologies our digital transcendence bears with it.

Consequently, the web demands to be recognized as both a living archive and an artifact of our era: a space where memory, identity, and innovation converge into a shared, though unstable, digital heritage. Yet, this heritage remains precarious. Despite ongoing efforts toward digital preservation, there is no certainty that our current networks, platforms, and digital expressions will survive the rapid obsolescence of their physical substrates. The fragility of hardware, the ephemerality of data formats, and the entropic tendencies of technological ecosystems together pose a significant risk of historical amnesia. If neglected, the very infrastructures that sustain our digital transcendence may collapse into silence—leaving only traces of an era that once sought immortality in code.
